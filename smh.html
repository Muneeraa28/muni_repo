<h2><li>Cell wall</li></h2>
<p><img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/4ryTmWd2NOEEZwkrSVOppGwLXiA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Plant_cell_wall_diagram-en.svg-58a8766c3df78c345bdc5df3.png" width="400px" align="right"  >
<ol>A cell wall is a rigid, supportive outer layer found in plant, fungal, bacterial, and some archaeal cells.</ol> <ol>It provides structural support, shape, and protection to the cell, acting as a selective barrier.</ol> <ol>In plants, it's primarily composed of cellulose, while in fungi, it can contain chitin.</ol> <ol> It generally acts as a barrier between the cell's interior and the external environment. </ol> <ol>Different types of cells have variations in their cell wall composition. For example, plant cell walls are primarily composed of cellulose, while fungal cell walls contain chitin and glucans. Bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan</ol> </p> <br> <hr>
 
<h2><li>Cell Membrane</li></h2>

<p><ol> The cell membrane, also known as the plasma membrane, is a thin, flexible barrier that surrounds all cells, separating the cell's interior from its external environment.</ol>
<ol>It's primarily composed of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins and other molecules, giving it a semipermeable nature. </ol>
<ol> This allows the membrane to control the movement of substances in and out of the cell, maintaining cellular homeostasis and enabling various cellular processes.</ol> <hr></p>

<h2><li>Endoplasmic Reticulum</li></h2>
<img src="https://microbenotes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Diagram-of-Endoplasmic-Reticulum-ER.jpeg" width="300px" align="right"alt="">
<p><ol>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of membranes within a eukaryotic cell that plays a vital role in protein and lipid synthesis, folding, and transport.</ol> <ol>It's essentially a cellular transportation system, also involved in calcium storage and metabolism.</ol> <ol> The ER is categorized into two types: <br>Rough ER, studded with ribosomes and involved in protein synthesis, and smooth ER, lacking ribosomes and involved in lipid and steroid synthesis. </ol>
</p><hr>

<h2><li>Ribosomes</li></h2>
<img src="https://alevelbiology.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ribosome.jpg"width="200px"  align="right" alt="">
<p><ol>Ribosomes are essential cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis.</ol> <ol>They act as the sites where messenger RNA (mRNA) is translated into a specific sequence of amino acids, which then fold into functional proteins.</ol> <ol>These molecular machines are found in all cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic. </ol> <ol>Ribosomes read the genetic code carried by mRNA and match it with the corresponding amino acids. </ol></p>

<h2><li>Golgi Apparatus</li></h2>
<img src="https://www.news-medical.net/image-handler/picture/2016/6/Golgi_body_shutterstock_300259154.jpg" width="300px"  align="right" alt=""><br>
<p><ol>The Golgi apparatus is a cell organelle that functions as a processing and packaging center for proteins and lipids.</ol> <ol> It modifies, sorts, and packages these molecules, preparing them for transport to other parts of the cell or for secretion outside the cell. </ol> <ol>The Golgi apparatus consists of flattened, membrane-bound sacs called cisternae, often arranged in a stack. </ol> <ol>The Golgi apparatus is crucial for processing, packaging, and transporting proteins and lipids within the cell and to the outside.

<h2><li>Lysosomes</li></h2>

 <p><ol>Lysosomes are membrane-enclosed organelles that contain an array of enzymes capable of breaking down all types of biological polymersâ€”proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.</ol> <ol>They contain a variety of hydrolytic enzymes that break down cellular waste products, ingested material, and damaged cellular components. </ol></p> <br> <hr>

 <h2><li>Mitochondria</li></h2>
 <img src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgSSje3HIRMMVnxf8mYwSNJwIWsTGrtTnhQaRq2uATsG5hZW1udLpdN-sBUmOzIKN0Hx2KCeoSNj2qP3JUYue4PYzMJCNdDAbGGMjwih1lpKF1AJCffNmVFxdwbV0gaUe-PkZeL2-wK1Rs/s720/structure+and+function+of+mitochonria.PNG"width="250px"  align="right" alt=""> <br>
 <p><ol>Mitochondria are cellular organelles, often referred to as the <b>"powerhouses of the cell"</b>, responsible for generating the majority of the cell's energy in the form of ATP through cellular respiration.</ol> <ol>They are found in nearly all eukaryotic cells and have their own DNA, distinct from the cell's nucleus. </ol></p> <br> <hr>

<h2><li>Plastids</li></h2>
<P><ol>Plastids are a group of organelles found in plant and algal cells, characterized by their double membrane and presence of DNA and ribosomes, similar to mitochondria</ol> <ol>Different types of plastids exist, such as <b>chloroplasts</b> (for photosynthesis), <b>chromoplasts</b> (for pigment storage), and <b>leucoplasts </b>(for storage of various substances). 
</ol></P> <hr>

<h2><li>Nucleus</li></h2>

<p><ol> The structure in a cell that contains the chromosomes. The nucleus has a membrane around it, and is where RNA is made from the DNA in the chromosomes. Enlarge. Parts of a cell.
</ol> <ol>The nucleus controls and regulates the activities of the cell (e.g., growth and metabolism) and carries the genes, structures that contain the hereditary information.</ol></p> <br>
